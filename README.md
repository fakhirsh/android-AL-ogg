android-AL-ogg
==============

Play .ogg files on android using OpenAL.

This repo contains code to demonstrate the following:

1) Play ogg files using OpenAL for android. Custom callbacks written for ogg/vorbis decoder to stream sound files directly from memory instead of files o disk.

2) Load png files using libpng. Custom callbacks written for libpng to stream sound files directly from memory.


Note: While developing this module I did research on the net and used maybe GLP3 code somewhere {I think links are given where appropriate}. So please use this code as a study guide only and then maybe write your own for final release, its really not that hard!
